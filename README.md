## My introduction:
My name is Alexis, 27 years old, brazilian and as a good brazilian i like soccer and travelling, and as a good dev, i love code, especially UX and RPA. As professional background I have worked in many areas for 8 years at Robert Bosch, There I learned and worked with python RPA projects, and with React, I have two close friend who has a company in Brazil and I make some freelance works to them.
lets year was really hard to me, so I decided to come to Germany to improve my Germans skills and to come back at my favorite city in the world: Karlsruhe, now I am working with light logistic in a place where I only can speak german, so I learned german, but now its time to get into my area again, and this opportunity is my goal and my dream right now!

## Presentation Steps:
1. UI SHOW TIME - Show the UI online showing all action possible
2. USEREDUCER AND USECONTEXT EXPLANATION - Explain that I think the better solution would be user Redux, but I didnt have a lot of time to make the configuration, so I decided to use the normal hooks, useReducer has less boilerplate and can manage the global state as Redux and the useContext to avoid drilling throught the components
3. USEREDUCER SHOW TIME - Show all the action and the code in the appReducer
4. UNIT TEST  AND TDD (TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT) SHOW TIME - Show all the unit test, and explain that I choose the vitest, because the configuration is faster than Jest, but the syntax is the same, so I made all unit test by every action
5. USECONTEXT SHOW TIME - After that show the context, with all the functions and explain that was used memo to only render the functions in the first render
6. COMPONENTS SCTRUTURE FOLDER - show the components structure folder
7. STYLED-COMPONENTS EXPLANATION - I used styled-components, because to focus on UX, i think it is the best stalization tool
8. CI - CONTINUOS INTEGRATIONS - explain that was created the CI to have all integrations control and to avoid integrations test errors
9. NEXT STEPS SHOW TIME
   1.  I would test the components using the react-testing-libary
   2.  I would improve the UX with beautiful-dnd lib to drag and drop and with keyboard clicks (keyDown => e.key)
   3.  I would improve the UI to be more modern
